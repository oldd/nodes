a light intro to programming and compsci, all in js
	no dom ever, all could be done in node

why
	because i want to
	bacause i can
	becasue i dont know that it exists
	because i think it could be helpful
what
	not a complete college level intro
	enough for js devs to get a handle on
	requires basic comfort with language
	to complement a study in dom, webdev
	opensource
	convenient mk/gitbook/repo format
	a reference for those who know
	a place to discuss
	pure-js for devs	


concerns
	tell stephen?

(programming-and-paradigms)

Programming Languages and Paradigms
Procedural Programming
JS language basics
	different from others because it talks about each part as the role it plays
OOP vs FP
OOP
	Intro
	using single objects
	ways of using objects
		the native way - prototypical
		the functional way - factories
		the classical way - contrived
	fancy hybrid design patterns
	op-eds
FP
data structures
	in both paradigms
algorithms
recursion



to place	
	testing?  nah methinks
	writing readable code
